# Codecademy-Find_your_hat

This is my solution to the challenge project called 'Find your hat' from Codecademy. I have used Javascript(ES6) to develop it.

Project Goals
In this project, youâ€™ll be building an interactive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

Once you have downloaded and installed Node.js and NPM to your computer, you have to run node main.js to start the game.

Here you can see a sample of how it would look the game in your terminal.
